							<p> This page assesses Healal's fundamental skills, which he carefully analyses </p>
							<p> Here I evaluate myself in terms of the soft yet crucial skills that job work recruiters tend to search for in graduates. <br>
							I also comment on ones I considerably think I'm pretty good at. And also give examples on how I demonstrate this.
							Aside from this, I also ponder & reflect my personal characteristics about where I might need to improve on, where I need to put in more work. </p>
							
							<h4 class = "unitTitles"> Course in Context </h4> 
							
							<p> The following are some of the attributes graduate employers are typically keen on recruiting... </p>
		
							<!--  below list item gets a bold thick font applied -->
							<p> <b> Critical Thinking and Problem Solving </b> </p>
							<p> I am beginning to feel confident in this area in terms of evaluating and analysing a particular scenario,
							and then to be able to make a reasonable judgement from it such as in my IS unit I had analyse a particular problem
							to a given scenario issue, which I later made a justified reasoning	to the solution I thought-of. </p>
							
							<p> <b> Professionalism </b> </p>
							
							<p> Although, I am starting to feel confident in this area, such as finding a way to get a work assignment done
							and submitted in on-time. This demonstrates, as a result, reliability and trust I have as a person as well as an ordinary student.
							Despite this, I slightly think there still exist areas for further enhancements in this particular graduate skill </p>

					<section id = "secEvaluatedVerdict"> <!-- establishing a section with its ID name and content -->
						
						<!-- nested section to float and style distinguishably two separate elements  -->
						<section class = "evaluatedVerdict">
							
							<h3 class = "unitTitles"> Evaluated Verdict</h3>
					
							<p> Being an independent learner, I would personally say I feel I have started to nurture into this character type especially over the past year or so.
							Most of the time I carry out research into my unit topics out-of-class hours, putting extra effort in studying the next-day's lesson for example during my free-time in Uni.
							I think I am starting to mature myself as a grown adult -
							acting professionally and working professionally whether that's talking to other classmates or working/listening attentively in a room full of 150,200 people. </p>

							<h4 class ="unitTitles"> Course in Context </h4>
							
							<p> <b> Communication and Collaborative Leadership </b> </p>
							
							<p>  Again this is something which has been a weakspot over a few years, but in recent years I feel like I have started to feel confident in speaking with colleague
							group-collaborated project is, I think, a way to improve speaking to members, repsonding to them a helpful way to be active in speech-talking. </p>
							<p> An area where I like to develop, I feel I'm quite improving in communicating and interating with colleagues.
							This particular skill is highly useful and appreciated in the workplace of many business organisations and so this is regarded as one essential skill that many employers are in-search for.
							I think my ability to communicate and collaborate with other peer is at a satisfactory grade. However, my presentation skill is quite not upto standard, this is where I may need to practise key techniques over and over again to
							improve with the way and how I speak in front of audience - which can take a good amount of time to effectively communicate pleasingly well. </p>
								
							<p> <b> Learning and Research Skills </b> </p> <!-- this particular paragraph bold its text -->
							
							<p> In my own opinion, I truly reckon on this level 4 degree course I'm finding the ability to research information (on book, journal or online article)
							significantly more essential in my academic studies than never before! Through by reading and understanding the sources in a critical manner, I feel I'm utilising time substantially well.
							I can manage time productively, such as balancing my social and studies with ease rather than difficulty </p>
								
							<!-- referenced image source with an alternate meanningful text in case image does not display up -->
							<img id = "picSelfAssessMan" src = "ePortfolioSelfAssess.jpg" alt = "picture of a self reflection stick man">
							
							<p> I feel like I have a fair balanced awareness of the social/community aspects of Computer Science.
							I often stay up-to-date with some of the gossips and bulletins around the world of tech from mainly articles related to the gadget-industry
							but I do ocassioanlly check sites like <a href = "https://www.computing.co.uk/">www.computing.co.uk</a> and <a href = "https://www.computerweekly.com/">computerweekly.com</a>
							relating to my course, Computer Science.
							As a way of enagaging in extra-curricular activities, I'm currently participating in a Campus Football League, playing weekly with a group of University students
							competively against other students from a range of different year/level groups. As well as having fun,
							it has also been a way to communicate quite efffectively with the team that I play with regularly. </p>
