							<p> In the 1st term, this unit starts a project from the beginning carrying on throughout the year with an on-going group-based collaboration through each step and stage of the way. <br>
							At the time of writing, I am tasked to plan and analyse a particular system implementation to a business organisation using design diagrams such as UCDs, UCSs and ERDs.
							I had also just completed a 1500 word-limit report document on a business case study, setting out system requirements for it detailing what it required and describing how it may be used.  </p>
							
							<p> How do I feel about with the unit ?...
							Prior and independent study has massively improved with the way I engage with the course units such as this IS & DB unit. This is merely due to putting in practice, time and hardwork into extra 
							hours outside class-time. </p>

							<p> CSF unit provides the science behind the system, typically encompassing a fruitful range of topics that will be taught this academic year.
							From Digital Logic Gates and Boolean Algebra Circuits to computational mathematics topic of Sets, Matrices and Vectors!
							it's a unit underpinning the elements, components, peripherals, layered deep within systems. </br> </p>
							<p> In Laboratory classes, as a group, we had explored many different interactive combinations using: <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/">LogiSim</a>
							- a graphic-based application for designing and simulating digital logic circuits (simple/combinational/interdeterminate). Here, we could manually generate circuits on the canvas screen 
							or simply enter a given boolean expression on an in-tab generator. </p>

							<p> " How I'm feeling about the unit "... </p>
							<p> I think I feel that I'm coping well in terms of picking up new things really quick such as understanding how the 7-segment-display works
							For this unit in particular, I would truly say I haven't put enough hours privately comapred to my other modular units such as the Web Design and Programming units
							where I have put more hours into them more than this so far in the year. Prior studying does helps a lot, and research shows it does help in studies
							The next step I'd say, is to give equal amount of time in this CSF unit as well as others, including the Computing Mathematics part. </p>
