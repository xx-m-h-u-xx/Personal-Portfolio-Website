							<p> Kick-starting in a high-level langauge, Java, this Programming unit introduces the journey of building a code
							through the essence and principles of designing and constructing problems, as well as testing and solving scenario solutions.
							This unit includes understanding and implementing O-O (Object-Oriented) design, in order to model a real world-based problematic issues,
							with the use of appropriate coding methods and techniques. </p>

							<p> In the beginning of the 1st term, we had been introduced to Java Processing application, where we had initially began exploring simple graphics commands
							and libraries such as "Point", "Line","Ellipse", "Rect". From here onwards, we had progressively learnt most important aspects of Programming in Java. This included how to assign variables,
							how arithmetic operators are used in conjuction with boolean statements. Iteration loops such as "for" and "while" were taught and for me it was really tough getting a head around to it but I then slowly started practising these type of loop commands
							with the help of online guide. This helped me crucially as it explained in detail how looping really works with many scenario examples to try from. Conditional statements like "IF", "ELSE IF","ELIF", "ELSE" was something not too difficult to understand,
							as I have been familiar to these typical selectional statements back in college and high-school. Further in the term, something which is called "Top Down Design + Stepwise Refinement" were other programming aspect where we had been taught,
							given examples to study from in laboratory classes. Later on in the term, this unit will look at functions (how they are used to return and call-back a value, classes; instances; constructors as well as learning different procedural methods. </p>						
					
							<p> From starting from scratch and introducing the basics commands in Java's graphcial application called <a href = "https://processing.org/tutorials">Processing</a>,
							in the workshops of my lab classes, I had progressively experimented with different techniques I've been taught from previous lecture lessons.
							In my self-directed independent free time, I often go to the MyMMU portal and revisit the lessons that been taught previously in order to recap the skills learnt and develop an
							understanding upon what has been taught and said during lectures as well reviewing some of lab extension programming tasks on its Moodle page. </p>

							<p> This unit allows student to develop a critical understanding of how webpages deeply work, in precise how both HTML and CSS
							operate together as well as considering the end-users experience and suitability i.e. usability and accessibility. Exploring the back-end and front-end scripting.
							In addition to this, term 2 explores server-side scripting as well as interacting and using a portable web-based server. This will also include code work in MySQL and PHP.

							<p> In the beginning of this first term, we had been introduced to the basics of HTML and CSS. Here, in lectures we had explored a variety number of main HTML5 sematic tags that are used in modern webpages.
							CSS "box modelling" had been discussed both in lecture and lab workshops, figuring and exploring how elements in HTML are composed, configured and styled in CSS.
							In addition to this, CSS style "positioning" had also been looked at in lectures as well as practically enaging with this in laboratory classes.
							A most important aspect in the field of Web Development industry is the <strong> usability and accessbility </strong> of webpages. Here, we reviewed key factors
							that are required for both unaccesible users as well as casual and IT-savvy / literate individuals.

							<p> Using <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/>W3S web tutorials</a> as a help guide in developing my own ePortfolio for my assignment, this site has been the basic building block resource for me learning how to script code and apply it in HTML . </p>
							<p> As I had to produce a personal e-Portfolio for my Web Design assignment, this coursework has actually allowed me to seek and carefully contemplate the usability of different sort of users as well as different forms of platforms.
							This also includes many factors to take in consideration such as friendly-navigation, useable-interactivity and ensure compatibility. As a result, it was a means of making a webpage/s visually & aesthetically compelling and accessible.
							For this unit, I have worked and sginificantly put extra hour in my ability to code in HTML and CSS by exercising myself with webinars, videos and tutorials. Overall, I think Web Design is something I'm keen on developing later and throughout the year, as I am really, in fact, <strong> loving and enjoying </strong> this! </p>
